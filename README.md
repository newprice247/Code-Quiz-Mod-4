## Description

The goal of this project was to build a web app that functions as a timed coding quiz. It features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. 

## Finished Project

### Comments

* Upon loading the initial page, there is a link to view other user's high scores, a code-quiz title and welcome message, and a button that when clicked starts the questionaire and a countdown timer.
* Once the quiz begins, the user has 60 seconds to complete the quiz, and the remaining time as it counts down is displayed on-screen. If a correct answer is chosen, the user's score is increased and a message of 'Correct!' is displayed on screen. If an incorrect answer is chosen, the timer countdown has 15 seconds subtracted and a 'Wrong!' message ,as well as which answer was correct, is displayed on-screen.
* As the questionare continues, the user will choose if they want a variety of different characters including numbers, upper- and lower-case letters, and special characters(ex. @#$%@!).
* If the user doesn't choose any of the characters provided, an alert window displays to inform the user to choose at least one set of characters, and the questionare resets.
* Based on the user's chosen characters and password length, a random password will be generated and displayed on screen inside of the empty container above the generate button.
